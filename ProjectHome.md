Initially opened the project to track my own changes to devilspie. It also includes a window focus switcher called `windowfocus', which turned out to be very useful for those who wants to control everything with a single keyboard.

Feel free to commit your own stuff, however unsophisticated it is. Nobody cares about the code structure or code elegance as long as it works.

DOWNLOAD:
<pre>
$ svn checkout http://devilspie-star.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ devilspie-star<br>
</pre>

Depending on the settings, some window manager prevents an application like
devilspie from switching focuses between existing windows. To disable this focus
prevention on Compiz, open "CompizConfig settings manager" and follow:
General Options > Focus & Raise Behavior > Focus Prevention Level > [the value to "Off" ](set.md)
